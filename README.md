# Image Segmentation with Machine Learning
[~ By Mayuresh Patil]()

We segment i.e. divide the images into regions of different colors which helps in distinguishing an object from the other at a finer level.

## Types of Image Segmentation
1. Semantic Segmentation:
Semantic Segmentation is the process of segmenting the image pixels into their respective classes
2. Instance Segmentation
Instance segmentation is being more thorough and usually comes into picture when dealing with multiple objects.

## Image Segmentation Applications
1. Self-driving cars
2. Circuit Board Defect Detection
3. Face detection
4. Medical Imaging
